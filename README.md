# WHMCS_DECODED_v741

WHMCS v 7.4.1 Full - Decoded (deioncubed) & Nulled and free updates!

we are happy to announce that our team has fully deioncubed the WHMCS and nulled ( removed all callbacks ).

decoded pure PHP code The program code is full decoded from Ioncube, unprotected and you don't need Ioncube Loader extension anymore.

This is not usual WHMCS "nulled" package, like everyone else is selling. Not usual just cracked license file version, all other files ioncube encoded, with all the home-calls still active and waiting for your installation to be detected an blocked! 

This is different unique package. You get from me what no one is able to provide - the pure PHP version! So you can investigate and change the code. This fully decoded pure PHP version is also great for programmers, to get to know how the code works, and change it if needed!

This version allows to populate any CONFIG details and sign in to that admin. We are building admin module that let you add unlimited number of WHMCS config details and select from dropdown on admin/login.php. 

Host unlimited number of WHMCS install from 1 software.

100% nulled All callbacks ("home calls") back to the original developers are removed, so your software can't and won't get blocked!

Enter your own license, NO Call Backs to Confirm. No Branding!
